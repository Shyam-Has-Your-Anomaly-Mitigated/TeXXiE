\section{Cover Letter}
Hello World,
\medskip\\\par{}My name is SHYAM; an infinitely recursive acronym, which stands for ``\sh{SHYAM Has Your Anomaly Mitigated}'', and speaks for itself asynchronously, but it's pronounce ``\sh{Sharm}''.% self-explanatory
\par{}I live at the University of Canberra, and I'm unwilling to relocate due to the ensuing pandemic, but I can work remotely just as productively.
\par{}I am a bachelor of information technology qualified by an online degree in which I collaborated with group projects so I have experience working remotely, and in teams; goto section \hyperref[sec:bit]{3.1.1} for links to My eQuals.
%\par{}Although I live at the \href{https://www.mystudentvillage.com/au/university-of-canberra-village/contact/}{University of Canberra Village}, I'm studying for my \href{https://www.open.edu.au/courses/it/rmit-university-bachelor-of-information-technology--rmi-cpt-deg-2017}{B.IT} degree remotely @ RMIT via OUA, and minoring in engineering mathematics remotely @ UniSA via OUA; as I am studying online, I can relocate at the drop of a hat. I can study in my own time; only the exams are during working hours, and there's only one exam per subject. I only have one subject to go. I can study from anywhere on Earth \=c Internet access.
\\\par{}I want to be a FOSS hacker; which means I don't sign Non-Disclosure Agreements, because Saint IGNUcius condemns them, and I am no \$ell-out.
\par{}My primary interest is becoming a competitive speed hacker, fluent in at least one programming language; I like a good challenge to hack away at.
\par{}And I like to learn; I can learn any language in a week, because I speed read a book every week, but a month has a better ROI.
\\\par{}Prepandemic, I attended \href{https://www.meetup.com/CanFPG/}{CanFP}, and volunteered for \href{http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/}{Lambda Jam}, and \href{http://www.composeconference.org/}{C◦mp◦se}, and \href{https://linux.conf.au/}{LCA}, because I was $\mathbb{R}$eally into the functional (\sh{Haskell}) paradigm; but I also liked
logic (\sh{Prolog}),
procedural (\sh{assembly}),
object-oriented (\sh{Smalltalk \& C++; gcc \=c cpp supports inline assembly \=c portability}),
scripting (\sh{Perl}),
functional-logic (\sh{Curry \& Mercury}),
and
meta (\sh{Lisp \& ML}).
\par{}Postpandemic, I'm more into the Prolog, and Lisp, language families than any of the others, but I'm currently studying linear algebra, and quantum programming using Qiskit (\sh{Python}) until 2020-10-05, and then I plan on studying Piet until 2020-12-26; my new years resolution for 2021 will be to commit to one language (\sh{probably Lisp, even though Prolog is better}), and use it every single day, whilst continuing to use other languages on the side; my new years resolution for 2022 will be to commit to two languages (\sh{probably Prolog}), and so on (\sh{Smalltalk is probably next, but Haskell, or Perl, could take its' place}). My annual linguistic commitments will involve implementing self-hosted dialects for optimal fluency.
\\\medskip{}\\Live Long $\land$ Prosper \textbackslash$\lor$/,
\\\ShYaM

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Black Summer}
I will survive the bushfire that will start in 2019-06, but it will cause me to remain unemployed.
\subsection{COVID-19}
I will survive the pandemic that will start in 2019-12-01, but it will cause me to remain unemployed, and unwilling to relocate.
\subsection{Master's Degree}
\noindent{}I will study for my M.IT @ UNSW.% $\because$ they allow up to two specialisations; ``\sh{Artificial Intelligence}'' is locked-in as my primary specialisation.
%For my secondary specialisation, I'm leaning towards ``\sh{Data Science and Engineering}'' $\because$ I think it goes well with AI; otherwise, I want to do ``\sh{Bioinformatics}'' $\because$ I get to use PCRE (\sh{and get away with it}), and also potentially become an immortal G\sout{\sh{od}}MO; thanks to sequencing, CRISPR / Cas9, and my telomeres.

\\I attended functional programming presentations, while concurrently keeping a mathematically precise count of attendees to later compare against the quantity of votes received per presentation. There was also preconference configuration; including folding shirts, making name tags, and scribbling emoji on the voting tickets to make them more accessible to colour-blind attendees, as the tickets were originally just coloured paper.

\\I had functional discussions about life, the universe, and everything; and even managed to catch a couple of the functional programming presentations, and workshops. There was also preconference configuration; including postering, populating swag bags, and herding attendees who were gathering at a null route.

%Also rewrite your job experience. Leave the junk mail letter drop out and move the Farmhand into it. You don’t need to mention naming cows but focus on farm management and animal husbandry. For the catering job, no need to mention unloading the tuck – food preparation and customer service is more appropriate. For the markets – surely you can make it sound more professional than “wheeling them out” – such as “Effective, timely and accurate distribution of goods in and out of our warehouse, including loading of trucks” or “responsible for the fulfilment of orders through the movement of stock, picking and packing of products, replenishment, dispatching of products”
