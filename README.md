# TeXXiE

ℝeal Programmers don't use word processors.
<br>ℝeal Programmers use [TeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/7278/reasons-to-use-plain-tex).
<br>ℝeal Programmers use [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language))

## ℝeal Programmers are [Language Prescriptionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription) *([Byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_G) your [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym) out [Vsauce](https://youtu.be/mjy5eokIm3U?t=27m36s)!)*

*Coining "-thing"s is part of contributing to society; respect the contributors, or DIY!!! ...I mean, it's not like human language has naming conventions, nor any "-thing"? And dubbing "-thing"s is disrespectful; especially foreign langauges (that's what subtitles are for).*

Why call them "Fibonacci numbers", and not "Hindu numbers"?
<br>**Fibonacci wasn't the first to [discover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Origins) the integer sequence.**

Why call it "Hindu-Arabic numerals", and not just "Hindu numerals"?
<br>**Arab traders brought Hindu mathematics to Europeans, who only refer to it as "Arabic" because of who they first observed using it, which is [analphabetically nescient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system#Etymology).**

Why call it a "newton", and not just (£2,240) "ton"?
<br>**The benighted "Sir" Isaac Newton may have made significant contributions to society, but he's an intellectual kleptomaniac who attempted to [plagiarise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy) Leibniz' Calculi; the Gilderoy Lockhart of Mathematica.**

Thomas Edison...the animal abuser...the Gilderoy Lockhart of Scientifica. (Need to fact check, and think of something witty...)

### TeX [(pronounced "tech"; pronounced "teck")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#Pronunciation_and_spelling)
[iTeX](https://youtu.be/eKaI78K_rgA?t=13m29s) ([transcript](http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb31-2/tb98knut.pdf#page=2)) will replace TeX; and when it does, ℝeal Programmers carry bells.

### Trekkie [(not trekker)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie#Trekkie_vs._Trekker)
	Gene Roddenberry responded with "No, it's 'Trekkies.' I should know — I invented the thing."

### Techie [(pronounced "tecky")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_repair_technician)
ℝeal Programmers carry (sonic) screwdrivers.
<br>(ℝeal Programmers tap it on the mainframe to make it sonic, and concurrently discharge static electrons.)

### GIF [(pronounced "jiff")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Pronunciation_of_GIF)
	The creators of the format pronounced the word as "jif" with a soft "G" /ˈdʒɪf/ as in "gin".

### Cache [(pronounced "cash")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing))
I used to call this "kashé", and a friend used to call it "'kaysh"; I wonder if anyone's ever started it with an 's' sound...or "catch"? (That actually sounds like storage!?!)
